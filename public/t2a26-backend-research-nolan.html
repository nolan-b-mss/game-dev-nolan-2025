Conclusion Here<br><br>
Firebase works pretty well. It's not very beginner friendly, but thats okay, because there is major AI assistance within.
AI-generated products are well made and successful.
My AI-generated product was a library of saved books and movies. Though you cannot access the REAL book and movie, it still provides an index, almost like a wikipedia, for anything that anyone can add onto.
As long as you are signed in to the "Admin" (default) account.
The product even includes a dashboard for quick access.

Firebase is probably the easiest because of the ability to AI-generate whatever you wish, with an AI made specifically for programming.<br>
Here are some images of the product.
