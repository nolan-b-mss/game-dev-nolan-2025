Conclusion<br><br>
Firebase works pretty well. It's not very beginner friendly, but thats okay, because there is major AI assistance within.
AI-generated products are well made and successful.
My AI-generated product was a library of saved books and movies. Though you cannot access the REAL book and movie, it still provides an index, almost like a wikipedia, for anything that anyone can add onto.
As long as you are signed in to the "Admin" (default) account.
The product even includes a dashboard for quick access.

Firebase is probably the easiest because of the ability to AI-generate whatever you wish, with an AI made specifically for programming.<br>

Prompt:<br>
Make a php, node, or python backend that when the link is clicked the single file will ALWAYS generate a webpage with the heading "magic word" that has a textbox with the value "fred" in it and a submit button.<br>
When submitted the same file then reads the textbox and generates "Magic word found" if it matches "fred" and gives the hint "Try fred" if it does not match.
