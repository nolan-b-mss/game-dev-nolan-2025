Nolan's Game Development 11 Journal <br>
9/8/2025
I started my journal today. (this file)
We talked about the names of each other and getting to remember everyone's names.
Today we are talking about LLMs.
We will activate gitpage.
 	open repository, go to settings>pages
 		click on none and change it to main
 		click "save"
 		wait (~30s)
 		refresh, and the page should be there
We also began to talk abut if-statements
In example;

x=5
 	if(x>7){raise your hand}
 	else {lower your hand}
I got my own GitHub page to work. (https://nolan-b-mss.github.io/game-dev-nolan-2025/public/index.html)

Then we talked about different programming languages and what they can be used for, like;
 	JavaScript - webpages, cell phones, devices
 	Python - AI
 	C/C++ - fast, best
 	C# (C sharp) - ???
CSS - ???
HTML is NOT a programming language, its mainly used for redirecting, formatting, and other similar things. (That was from my knowledge, it may be incorrect.)
Variables
Input/output
Decisions (if statements)
Events
Objects (variable 2)
Functions
Loops (forever, will not end until told to.)
Arrays (named variables)
Classes (everything)
