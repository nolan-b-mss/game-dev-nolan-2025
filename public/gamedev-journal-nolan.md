Nolan's Game Development 11 Journal <br>
9/8/2025 <br>
I started my journal today. (this file) <br>
We talked about the names of each other and getting to remember everyone's names. <br>
Today we are talking about LLMs. <br>
We will activate gitpage. <br>
 	open repository, go to settings>pages <br>
 		click on none and change it to main <br>
 		click "save" <br>
 		wait (~30s) <br>
 		refresh, and the page should be there <br>
We also began to talk abut if-statements <br> 
In example; <br>
<br>
x=5 <br> 
 	if(x>7){raise your hand} <br> 
 	else {lower your hand} <br> 
I got my own GitHub page to work. (https://nolan-b-mss.github.io/game-dev-nolan-2025/public/index.html) <br> 
<br>
Then we talked about different programming languages and what they can be used for, like; <br> 
 	JavaScript - webpages, cell phones, devices <br> 
 	Python - AI <br>
 	C/C++ - fast, best <br> 
 	C# (C sharp) - ??? <br> 
CSS - ??? <br> 
HTML is NOT a programming language, its mainly used for redirecting, formatting, and other similar things. (That was from my knowledge, it may be incorrect.) <br> 
Variables <br> 
Input/output <br> 
Decisions (if statements) <br> 
Events <br> 
Objects (variable 2) <br> 
Functions <br> 
Loops (forever, will not end until told to.) <br>
Arrays (named variables) <br> 
Classes (everything) <br>

Today we added to our index and made a new page for adding images onto a website. <br>
9/10/2025 <br>
We started assignment 2 on VIDEOFLAC. <br>
I am completely lost. <br>
9/11/2025 <br>
I learned how to make a working button that generates a number between 1-10 <br>
9/12/2025 <br>
I began to make a square that appears only when an even number is generated. <br>
I also started making it move. <br>
9/13/2025 <br>
I finished the square and it now works with no error. (this was all added to my VIDEO-FLAC file) <br>
