<br><br><li> Ask ChatGPT for a beginner friendly javascript Leet code question.

<br><br><li> Record the question on this webpage.

<br><br><li> Write your code to solve the problem within Pre tags.

<br><br><li> Ask ChatGPT to make an html javascript single file answer without any css.



<ol>
  <br><br><li> My prompt was;  "give me a beginner friendly javascript Leet code question"
  
  <br><br><li> ChatGPT got the question from <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/">here.</a> Here is the problem statement;
    
<pre>"Given an array of integers nums and an integer target,
return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution,
and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order."</pre>

  <br><br><li> Within PRE tags show your version of the leet answer without looking at the actual answer. <br>

  <pre>
    This code is in the pre tag
         it saves spaces and linebreaks
                    For example this is shifted in
  </pre>
  <br><br><li> Put the ChatGPT working code here. (Sensibly, it doest not need several tags that are not used)

</ol>
