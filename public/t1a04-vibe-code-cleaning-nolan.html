You need to put the cleaned code here. No CSS, no confusing divs and paragraphs. Just as simple as possible webpage  html. <br><br>

If doing javascript script are the variables sensibly named camelCase "myVar" etc do't use promises (.then) instead use async/await, no addEventListeners unless necessary, get chatGPT to make the changes. More changes... Only simple javascript nothing fancy.

Here is the original vibecode<br>
